# DATA SCIENCE JOB SIMULATION BCG X

Overview
In this professional simulation, three Jupyter notebooks were developed to showcase the results:

## 1st Notebook: BCG_explore
The client provided more than three datasets:

- Historical Customer Data: includes usage, registration date, forecasted consumption, etc.
- Historical Price Data: includes variable and fixed price information.
- Churn Indicator: whether each customer has churned or not.
- As the first step, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand and visualize these datasets.

## 2nd Notebook: feature_engineer
The client proposed the following idea:
“I believe that the difference between off-peak prices in December and January of the previous year could be an important feature for predicting customer churn.”

In this notebook, we applied feature engineering to create new columns aimed at improving churn prediction accuracy.

## 3er Cuaderno: model_predictions
Generamos y entrenamos un modelo de predicción utilizando un bosque aleatorio para predecir la rotación de clientes.

## This project demonstrates the use of data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to enhance customer retention prediction.
